# Unagent
A Safari extension to modify the user agent per website.

**Download: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6448220941)**

## Why I built this
There wasn't any user agent changer per website on the App Store at the time I started developing this extension, and using a separate browser/app on iOS to do web searches was troublesome.

Since Safari supports the web extensions manifest, I decided to port [bing-chat-unblocker-chrome](https://github.com/ellisy0/bing-chat-unblocker-chrome) and build it for iOS and macOS.

## Development

### What works
- Basic user agent selection
- Per site settings
- Custom user agents
